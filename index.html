            <p>
              Before I began my web development journey, I never really knew the
              limits of my laptop. Once I started learning to code and was
              confident enough to learn more technologies, other than just
              dabbling in plain HTML and CSS, is when I started to see the
              cracks.
            </p>
            <h3>The <em>first casualty</em>. Enter Angular</h3>
            <p>
              After learning some vanilla JavaScript and discovering a whole new
              world of frameworks, I decided to try
              <a href="https://google.com" target="_blank">Angular</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was less than a week of dabbling in the framework that I almost
              did this to my laptop :laugh:
            </p>

              I‚Äôll never forget the time I built an Angular project that took 17
              minutes to complete. It was then and there that I knew my brief
              acquaintance with the framework had come to a bitter-short end.
            </p>

            <!-- about Fluttter -->
            <h3>‚ÄòMobile developer‚Äô sounded good. Enter Flutter</h3>
            <p>
              I wouldn‚Äôt wish this on anyone. I remember it taking so long to
              build a Flutter app that I thought I had broken my laptop and,
              mind you, I wasn‚Äôt even using a virtual emulator opting to use my
              phone to run the Flutter app on because that was the only way that
              I could try out the language.
            </p>
            <p>
              Never has 22 minutes seemed like an eternity. It was then and
              there that my relationship with Flutter ended as quickly as it had
              begun. Till we meet again Flutter, till we meet again üëã

              framework happened to be the sweet spot and after dabbling in it
              for a couple of weekends, I decided to pursue it fully.
            </p>
            <p>
              It takes 9 minutes for me to create a new Vue project and I know
              that‚Äôs nothing to write home about but, believe me when I say
              this, my friend, those fewer minutes are worlds apart from the
              time it takes to create an Angular project or build a Flutter app
              on my laptop.

              A large portion of my journey in web development has been spent on
              this piece of furniture.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most people have proper desk setups with height adjustable seats,
              well, not me. I have two buffed up cushions for the optimal
              sitting height. I had put my sewing skills from another life to
              the test when I made those brown leather (<em
                >synthetic, of course</em
              >) cushion covers üòÖ

              is the only answer I have for you. Those seemingly short breaks in

              to get in some much needed stretching.

              <strong>Jonny <em>Wood-Boy</em></strong> who used to carry around
              a plank of wood which was, unsurprisingly, named
              <strong>Plank</strong>. The two were so acquainted, nearly
              inseparable.

              Well, I‚Äôve grown quite attached to my plank. I cut a piece of
              plywood at just the right width and height that it sits perfectly
              on the right and left arm rests of the sofa.
            </p>
            <p>
              It offers enough room for my bulky laptop which sits centered, my
              handy mouse which sits on the right side and my phone on the left
              churning out as much chill music as I can listen to. The plywood
              also has just enough room for me to lay my notebook below the
              mouse and jot down some useful notes and as an added bonus, I
              avoid the hefty laptop weighing down my lap and it acts as
              insulation from the amount of heat that this big boy produces
              whenever we‚Äôre <em>fingers deep</em> in a coding session.

            <!-- about vs code -->
            <h3>Editor's choice. Enter VS Code ‚òï</h3>
            <p>
              I believe
              <strong>
                <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank"
                  >VS Code</a
                ></strong
              >
              is among the best, if not the best code editor. Once I switched
              over from using
              <strong
                ><a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a></strong
              >, I don't think I‚Äôll ever use anything else as my main editor.
            </p>
            <p>
              The versatility of the editor and the vast amount of useful
              extensions it offers has made my life easier and I'm sure that
              you'd agree too if you use the editor. These extensions have made
              my self-taught journey easier and I've honestly learnt how to
              write code more quickly and efficiently. That being said, let me
              now mention how long it takes for me to open up a project in
              <strong>Code</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              After clicking the <strong><em>Open with Code</em></strong> option
              from the context menu, I <strong><em>wait</em></strong> for the
              project files to be loaded into the editor. If luck is on my side
              that day and I don‚Äôt get greeted with a
              <strong><em>window not responding</em></strong> message, I
              <strong><em>wait</em></strong> for the code to be parsed and for
              extensions to load. Once the colour highlighting kicks in, that‚Äôs
              when I know I‚Äôm ready to start coding. The process takes about 3
              to 5 minutes depending on how big the code files are.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, since I started working on larger projects, I‚Äôve found
              myself more often in situations where with larger code files like
              Vue components that contain more code in the template, script and
              styles sections, the code files don‚Äôt usually get parsed
              correctly. Things like colour highlighting and auto-completion
              fail to load and I usually find myself staring at what I can only
              describe as a giant text file with no visual separation anywhere
              in the syntax. The only remedy for that being to close down the
              editor and open up the project again, hoping that the next time
              round is the charm üòÇ
            </p>
            <p>
              If all loads well at this point, starting a local development
              server kicks the time up to a total of around 9 minutes. This,
              mind you, is time calculated after the laptop already powered on
              and everything had loaded prior to opening up the project in
              <strong>Code</strong>. Add to that my Windows load time and we're
              way past the 15-minute mark before I can get ready to code.
            </p>
            <p>
              All this loading and waiting that I have to sit through might
              sound like a deal breaker for you, but my IDE is one compromise
              that I can't make. So whenever I start a new project or open an
              existing one, I use the time, the
              <strong><em>load time</em></strong> I mean, to plan how I'm going
              to tackle the tasks ahead or even have some tea as I
              <strong><em>wait</em></strong

            </p>
            <p>
              I still keep <strong>Sublime Text</strong> around cause it's
              lightweight and less resource intensive, so whenever I'm working
              on a project in <strong>Code</strong> and I need to refer to some
              old code I wrote in another project, I prefer viewing it in
              <strong>Sublime</strong> rather putting more strain on the already
              stretched resources by opening up another project in
              <strong>Code</strong> üò´

              having my laptop connected to an active internet connection

              noticeably - A major pain. A pain that became, quite frankly,

                the actual characters I typed in appear onscreen üòÇ
              </li>

            <p>
              As you can clearly tell, this is quite a painful process that
              takes what seems like an eternity to complete. On average it‚Äôs
              around 15 minutes before I actually write a single line of code or
              more if I hadn‚Äôt already launched my code editor before connecting
              to the Internet.

              Now you know why I prefer to have some fonts installed locally on
              my laptop. At least that way, whenever I'm working on designs, I
              have access to the fonts hence I can easily make the designs
              appear exactly as I had intended. As a plus, when I'm working on a
              project, I also have quick access to the fonts.

              I bet you that right now, you have multiple tabs running on your
              browser and since the introduction of grouped tabs, I'm pretty
              sure that the total number of tabs in your phone‚Äôs browser is
              quite a lot. I know this because I personally I‚Äôm a culprit.

              You might find yourself having an article that you can‚Äôt get to
              reading right away and so, you opt not to close that tab. Every
              new search you perform on a new tab and before you know it, your
              tab numbers are soaring through double and triple digits.

              Well, I wish that was the case for me on my

                ><strong>Movie Database</strong></a

              passable Internet connection.
            </p>

              And as an added bonus, my friend majored in Computer Science so it

              The feeling of using a computer that bended to your every will
              without breaking a sweat was exhilarating. I felt like, prior to
              that moment, I had never used a computer before in my life. I
              would click on the browser icon and in the blink of an eye the app
              was served up and ready for use. I remember having multiple tabs
              open and switching back and forth between them was such a breeze.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even the simple mindless action of closing a browser tab brought
              me such joy. Joy I never thought my weary heart could feel. If
              felt like the stuff of dreams, just clicking on anything you
              wanted to and having that action executed near instantaneously.
            </p>
            <p>
              That experience made me dream about my future in this field and

              Well, that's not my case, that's not how I learnt to design for

              It's when I started my web development journey that I really
              started to harness the power of <strong>Inkscape</strong>. I use
              it for <em>color scheming</em>, <em>wire framing</em>,
              <em>editing and cropping images</em> and
              <em>making other assets</em> that I use for the web including the
              profile picture I've used on this blog.
            </p>
            <p>
              It does everything that I could possibly need it to do and enough
              so that I never bothered finding out what the competition had to
              offer.

              When I got the laptop, it was clear to see that it had gone
              through some pretty rough times. Above you can see the state that
              the original keyboard was in. Some keys were missing, lost in a
              place unknown, and the ones that were intact were really hard to
              actuate. The story of what happened to this poor keyboard is best
              left for the previous owner. You and I can only imagine the life
              that it was subjected to.

            <p>I wouldn't want to see the floor where all this happened.</p>
            <p>
              Soon after I got it, I walked into a repair shop which was more of
              a junk yard for dead computers, TVs and other electronics that
              seemed to be in use way back before I arrived on the blue planet.
              Many of which didn't seem like they would ever see another day of
              life. They seemed like they were just there to be
              <em>bled dry</em> for parts. To date, I still wonder if even half
              of them had any owners who were coming back for them or the owners
              had resigned to the hash truth of their realities and just
              entirely decided to pawn their electronics as parts or just
              forfeited them entirely.
            </p>
            <p>
              So I asked the repair guy if he could find me a keyboard.
              <em>Not if he had a keyboard, but if he could find one.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em
                >The convention when going to repair shops, since I can
                remember, has always been to ask if they 'could find' whatever
                part it was that you were looking for and if the repair guy said
                he didn't have what you needed, you'd see him walk out of his
                shop carrying your device and he'd tell you to follow him as he
                took you to the various other repair shops around as he asked on
                your behalf if they could find the part which you were
                looking.</em
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              <em
                >He‚Äôd do this for you at about two or three other shops with no
                luck and then he'd turn to you and tell you to give him your
                phone number and that he‚Äôd be sure to let you know if he found
                any of the parts you were looking for. Sometimes he never did
                and you were basically forced to accept your device‚Äôs fate and
                just come back to the repair shop and sell it for parts. At
                least that way, you didn't have a dead piece of tech taking up
                space and gathering up dust in your home.</em
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              Fortunately for me, the repair guy took a quick glance at my
              laptop and then walked into the back of his shop and a few moments
              later emerged carrying in his hand what seemed to be the twin
              sibling of my laptop.
            </p>
            <p>
              I felt like the luckiest Joe alive because he had the same exact
              laptop as mine, although that one was far too gone, but at least
              it had one thing going for it,
              <strong><em>the keyboard</em></strong
              >.
            </p>
            <p>
              He then gracefully removed the keyboard from the old relic and
              switched it out with mine. After a quick test of all the keys in a
              text document and the affirmation that they were all responsive,
              the light at the end of the tunnel started shining a tad brighter
              üòä
            </p>
            <p>
              It's a shame that I couldn't get to fix the broken front bezel
              because someone else had already gotten that piece of the
              <em>pie</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Looking back at that moment, I'm glad I got the most important
              part ‚Äì the keyboard.
            </p>
            <p>
              A keyboard that I happened to find on one random afternoon that
              turned out to be the exact match for my laptop ended up being
              instrumental in my self-taught journey as web developer. Not to
              forget that it also proudly brings you this blog üòÇ

            <!-- about charger -->
            <h3>Fresh out of Juice. Enter the charger ‚ö°</h3>
            <p>
              The charger has definitely seen better days and since it‚Äôs the
              laptop‚Äôs original charger, I‚Äôm surprised that it's still kicking.
              It was definitely built to last.
            </p>
            <p>
              The number of times other people and I have accidentally come into
              contact with the cable making it wiggle in its slot which in turn
              happened to shut down my laptop is countless. This charger is a
              delicate, but very important piece of the puzzle, despite sections
              of it being buried in multiple layers of electrical tape at the
              joints as reinforcements.
            </p>
            <p>
              At some point, the cable kept slipping out of its port all on its
              own kicking me out of a coding session every single time because
              the laptop shut down. That's when I decided to wedge in a piece of
              paper into the charging port to keep that from happening. It works
              üòÖ
            </p>

            <!-- about battery -->
            <h3>It‚Äôs a brick? No. It‚Äôs a stand? Yes. Enter the battery üîã</h3>
            <p>
              The battery gave out a few years prior to me getting my hands on
              the laptop and ever since, the laptop has been operating like a
              desktop computer -
              <strong>if there's no power, there's no using it</strong> üò§
            </p>
            <p>
              Here‚Äôs another fun fact for you, I can't even power on the machine
              if the battery is connected in its slot, so I just use the charger
              as my power source and the battery, albeit dead, is not all that
              useless. I use it to elevate the laptop, just as you would use the
              stands found at the bottom of many keyboards. This elevation
              serves two purposes;
              <strong
                ><em
                  >the first is to give me a slightly better typing angle</em
                ></strong
              >
              and
              <strong
                ><em
                  >the second, the most important purpose, is to allow for a
                  much better air flow</em
                ></strong
              >.

            <figure class="gif-container">

            </figure>
            <p>
              The laptop sits flat on the table and with the one tiny intake fan
              located on bottom of it, it barely gets in any air and when it
              starts to heave, nearly, every half hour or so due to the
              <em>load</em> of work I‚Äôve thrown at it, you might think that
              there‚Äôs a <strong>Boeing</strong> taking off from my laps üòÇ
            </p>
            <p>
              So the small gap created between the laptop‚Äôs bottom and the table
              as a result of using the battery as a stand definitely helps,
              allowing for a much better air flow.
