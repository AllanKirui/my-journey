            <p>
              Before I began my web development journey, I never really knew the
              limits of my laptop. Once I started learning to code and was
              confident enough to learn more technologies, other than just
              dabbling in plain HTML and CSS, is when I started to see the
              cracks.
            </p>
            <h3>The <em>first casualty</em>. Enter Angular</h3>
            <p>
              After learning some JavaScript and discovering a whole new world
              of frameworks, I decided to try
              <a href="https://google.com" target="_blank">Angular</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was less than a week of dabbling in Angular that I almost did
              this to my laptop :smile:
            </p>

              <img
                src="/assets/img/guaton-computadora.gif"
                alt="computer rage GIF"
                width="640"
              />

            </figure>
            <p>
              Iâ€™ll never forget the time I built an Angular project that took 19
              minutes to complete. It was then and there that I knew my brief
              acquaintance with the framework had come to a bitter-short end.
