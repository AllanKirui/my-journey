            <p>
              Before I began my web development journey, I never really knew the
              limits of my laptop. Once I started learning to code and was
              confident enough to learn more technologies, other than just
              dabbling in plain HTML and CSS, is when I started to see the
              cracks.
            </p>
            <h3>The <em>first casualty</em>. Enter Angular</h3>
            <p>
              After learning some vanilla JavaScript and discovering a whole new
              world of frameworks, I decided to try
              <a href="https://google.com" target="_blank">Angular</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was less than a week of dabbling in the framework that I almost
              did this to my laptop :laugh:
            </p>

            <p>
              Iâ€™ll never forget the time I built an Angular project that took 17
              minutes to complete. It was then and there that I knew my brief
              acquaintance with the framework had come to a bitter-short end.
            </p>

            <!-- about Fluttter -->
            <h3>â€˜Mobile developerâ€™ sounded good. Enter Flutter</h3>
            <p>
              I wouldnâ€™t wish this on anyone. I remember it taking so long to
              build a Flutter app that I thought I had broken my laptop and,
              mind you, I wasnâ€™t even using a virtual emulator opting to use my
              phone to run the Flutter app on because that was the only way that
              I could try out the language.
            </p>
            <p>
              Never has 22 minutes seemed like an eternity. It was then and
              there that my relationship with Flutter ended as quickly as it had
              begun. Till we meet again Flutter, till we meet again ðŸ‘‹
            </p>

            <!-- about vue -->
            <h3>Would you look at that! Enter Vue ðŸ˜ƒ</h3>
            <p>
              The VueJS framework happened to be the sweet spot and after
              dabbling in it for a couple of weekends, I decided to pursue it
              fully.
            </p>
            <p>
              It takes 9 minutes for me to create a new Vue project and I know
              thatâ€™s nothing to write home about but, believe me when I say
              this, my friend, those fewer minutes are worlds apart from the
              time it takes to create an Angular project or build a Flutter app
              on my laptop.
            </p>

            <!-- TODO: insert missing sections -->
            <!-- about vs code -->
            <h3>Editor's choice. Enter VS Code â˜•</h3>
            <p>
              I believe
              <strong>
                <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank"
                  >VS Code</a
                ></strong
              >
              is among the best, if not the best code editor. Once I switched
              over from using
              <strong
                ><a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a></strong
              >, I don't think Iâ€™ll ever use anything else as my main editor.
            </p>
            <p>
              The versatility of the editor and the vast amount of useful
              extensions it offers has made my life easier and I'm sure that
              you'd agree too if you use the editor. These extensions have made
              my self-taught journey easier and I've honestly learnt how to
              write code more quickly and efficiently. That being said, let me
              now mention how long it takes for me to open up a project in
              <strong>Code</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              After clicking the <strong><em>Open with Code</em></strong> option
              from the context menu, I <strong><em>wait</em></strong> for the
              project files to be loaded into the editor. If luck is on my side
              that day and I donâ€™t get greeted with a
              <strong><em>window not responding</em></strong> message, I
              <strong><em>wait</em></strong> for the code to be parsed and for
              extensions to load. Once the colour highlighting kicks in, thatâ€™s
              when I know Iâ€™m ready to start coding. The process takes about 3
              to 5 minutes depending on how big the code files are.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, since I started working on larger projects, Iâ€™ve found
              myself more often in situations where with larger code files like
              Vue components that contain more code in the template, script and
              styles sections, the code files donâ€™t usually get parsed
              correctly. Things like colour highlighting and auto-completion
              fail to load and I usually find myself staring at what I can only
              describe as a giant text file with no visual separation anywhere
              in the syntax. The only remedy for that being to close down the
              editor and open up the project again, hoping that the next time
              round is the charm ðŸ˜‚
            </p>
            <p>
              If all loads well at this point, starting a local development
              server kicks the time up to a total of around 9 minutes. This,
              mind you, is time calculated after the laptop already powered on
              and everything had loaded prior to opening up the project in
              <strong>Code</strong>. Add to that my Windows load time and we're
              way past the 15-minute mark before I can get ready to code.
            </p>
            <p>
              All this loading and waiting that I have to sit through might
              sound like a deal breaker for you, but my IDE is one compromise
              that I can't make. So whenever I start a new project or open an
              existing one, I use the time, the
              <strong><em>load time</em></strong> I mean, to plan how I'm going
              to tackle the tasks ahead or even have some tea as I
              <strong><em>wait</em></strong
              >.
            </p>
            <p>
              I still keep <strong>Sublime Text</strong> around cause it's
              lightweight and less resource intensive, so whenever I'm working
              on a project in <strong>Code</strong> and I need to refer to some
              old code I wrote in another project, I prefer viewing it in
              <strong>Sublime</strong> rather putting more strain on the already
              stretched resources by opening up another project in
              <strong>Code</strong> ðŸ˜«
